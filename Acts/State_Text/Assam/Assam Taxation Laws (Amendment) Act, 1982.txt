Assam Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 1982_Section 4--> State(s): Assam In the Assam (Sales of Petroleum and Petroleum Products, including Motor Spirit and Lubricants) Taxation Act, 1955, in section 3, for sub-section (1), the following sub-section shall be substituted, namely :- "(1) There shall be levied and collected from every dealer a tax on his turnover from sales of the following goods at the rates specified against each :- (i) Motor spirit (except diesel Ten paise in the rupee; oil and internal combustion oil other than petrol) (ii) Lubricants Nine paise in the rupee; (iii) Diesel oil and other Eleven paise in the rupee; internal combustion oils other than petrol (iv) Kerosene not ordinarily Two paise in the rupee; used as an internal combustion oil (v) Crude oil Four paise in the rupee; (vi) Petroleum coke Four paise in the rupee; (vii) Petroleum gas and Seven paise in the rupee; natural gas (viii) All other products Seven paise in the rupee; obtained as derivatives of petroleum and/or natural gas Reasons for the enactment The Assam Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1939, and the Assam Purchase Tax Act, 1967, require that the rates of tax under these two Acts for every financial year should be specified in the annual Assam Finance Acts, It has, therefore, become necessary to lay down the rates of tax for the year 1982-83. The requirement to enact a separate Finance Act every year to specify the rates of agricultural income-tax and purchase tax for that year leads to difficulties when passage of the annual Finance Act is delayed for any reason. It is, therefore, proposed to incorporate the rates of tax effective from the 1st April, 1982, in the principal Acts themselves. This will dispense with the need for an annual Finance Act. It is also proposed to give relief to the tea industry in the matter of agricultural income-tax in view of the difficulties currently confronting that industry. 2. It is also proposed to fix the rates of sales tax in Assam on petroleum products fully on ad valorem basis instead of specific rates of tax and also to make some upward revision in the rates by suitably amending the Assam (Sales of Petroleum and Petroleum Products, including Motor Spirit and Lubricants) Taxation Act, 1955. 3. The Committee constituted under the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Assam State Legislature (Delegation of Powers) Act, 1982 (25 of 1982), has been consulted before the enactment of this measure as a President's Act.
