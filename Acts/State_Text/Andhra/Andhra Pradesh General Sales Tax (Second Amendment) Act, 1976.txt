Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax (Second Amendment) Act, 1976_Section 9--> State(s): Andhra Pradesh In the Fourth Schedule to the principal Act, for item 5-A, the following item shall be substituted, namely :- "5-A. Handloom cloth other than silk cloth.". The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax (Second Amendment) Bill, 1976 (Andhra Pradesh Gazette, Extraordinary, Part IV-A, dated 28th July, 1976, page 14.), runs as follows : "Section 5 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957, provides for the levy of tax on sales or purchases of goods. However, in certain circumstances goods sold or purchased are escaping tax. It is, therefore, proposed to levy tax at the rates specified in section 5 or section 6 on the purchases in the circumstances specified in the proposed new section 6-A. According to the existing provisions in section 14 of the Act, where an assessment, reassessment, rectification in, or revision of, assessment is to be made in pursuance or in consequence of or to give effect to any finding or directions contained in an order passed by an appellate authority or by any court, it has to be completed within a period of 4 or 6 years, as the case may be, from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates. It is proposed that in such cases a special period of limitation for assessment, reassessment, rectification in or revision of assessment should be provided as three years from the date of receipt of the order by the assessing or revising authority as the case may be. It is proposed to empower the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes having jurisdiction over the area to authorise officers below the rank of a Deputy Commissioner to enter into and search residential accommodation, without the need for obtaining a search warrant from a Magistrate. Under section 38-B of the Act the amount of turnover shall be rounded off to the nearest rupee. It is proposed to provide that the amount of turnover shall be rounded off to the nearest multiple of ten and that the amount so rounded off shall be deemed to be total turnover of the assessee. It is proposed to bring some more goods into single point tax system and to recast certain entries in the First and Second Schedules to remove ambiguities. This Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals."
