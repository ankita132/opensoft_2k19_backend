Andhra Pradesh Tax on Professions, Trades, Callings and Employments Act, 1987_Section Preamble--> State(s): Andhra Pradesh The Commercial Taxes Department is the nodal agency which collects the Profession Tax dues from professionals in the State.

The Constitution empowers the levy of Profession Tax subject to a maximum of Rs.2500/- p.a. and a minimum slab of as low as Rs.110/- p.a. This is an equitous levy based on the principle of ability to pay. The tax payers fulfill their Income Tax obligations by 31st March. And tax payers will be pleased to know that the Profession Tax paid by individuals/organisations is 100% rebatable against Income Tax dues and there is no additional levy. In fact, the Commercial Tax Department has no hesitation in terming the Profession Tax as a benevolent and beneficial tax. A 'quid pro quo' to tax payers own community and city.
