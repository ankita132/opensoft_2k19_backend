FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM As the amendments proposed in the Bill are mainly aimed at giving concessions to the trade from the existing provision, no additional revenue is expected on account of this Bill. MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION Clause 2 and 3 of the Bill authorise the Government to make rules and to issue notifications in respect of matters specified therein. All rules so made which are intended to cover matters mostly of procedural nature are to be laid on the Table of the Legislative Assembly of the State and will be subject to any modification made by the Legislative Assembly.
