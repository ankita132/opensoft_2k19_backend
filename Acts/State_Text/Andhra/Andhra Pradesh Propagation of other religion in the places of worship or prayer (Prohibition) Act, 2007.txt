Whereas, the founding fathers of our Republic had envisaged a polity that gave each citizen in our country the right to profess, practice and propagate religion of his or her choice; and this is the foundation of our Pluralist Society; And whereas, the fundamental right is circumscribed by the over arching concern to maintain pubic order, morality, and health; And whereas, the right to profess, practice and profess, practice and propagate religion is voluntary without any element of coercion; And whereas, if an activity of any individual or group of individuals is likely to adversely to impact public order, it needs to be curbed and reasonable restrictions can be placed on such activities; And whereas, in recent past, there have been number of instances where propagation of religious tenets in places of worship or prayer of one religious group by others has deeply hurt sentiments, disturbing peace and tranquility of that area; And whereas, such incidents were reported from the world-renowned ancient temple like Tirumala and there were strong protests; And whereas, the Government perceived these as unwarranted intrusion into one religious group's domain which potentially could disturb public order; And whereas, the Constitution of our country guarantees all citizens an equal entitlement to freedom of conscience and this recognition of individual freedom and the spirit of mutual respect and coexistence among various religious denominations is the bed rock of our country's ideological frame work enshrined in the Constitution; And whereas, it has been decided to prohibit the propagation of other religions in certain notified places of worship belonging to any particular religion mainly to ensure that the sentiments of that religious group are not hurt and public order is not disturbed; Be, it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Andhra Pradesh in the Fifty-eighth Year of the Republic of India, as follows:-
