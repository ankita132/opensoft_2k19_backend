The Statement of Objects and Reasons and the Memorandum Regarding Delegated Legislation appended to the Gujarat Sales Tax (Second Amendment) Bill, 1986 (Bill No. 39 of 1986) (Gujarat Government Gazette, Extraordinary, Part V, dated 15th March, 1986, page 19-9.), run as follows :- STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS "In order to augment the resources of the State, it is proposed to increase the existing rates of tax on sales or purchases of certain goods or classes of goods and to grant tax reliefs in respect of sales or purchases of certain goods or classes of goods as stated by the Finance Minister in his speech in the Legislative Assembly while presenting the budget estimates for the financial year 1986-87. This Bill seeks to amend the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, 1969 (Guj. 1. of 1970), with a view to giving effect to the said proposals. Opportunity is also taken to amend section 3A and delete section 46A. Under section 3A the limit of turnover of specified sales is specified as Rs. 50,000 but the limit in terms of value of taxable specified sales of goods specified in Schedule IV is not mentioned. It is, therefore, considered necessary to specify Rs. 5,000 as such limit. Under section 46A an undue advantage is being taken by dealers in delaying recovery of tax from them. Hence it is considered necessary to delete the same." MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION "Sub-clause (2) of clause 1 empowers the State Government to appoint by notification in the Official Gazette the date on which the Act shall come into force. New entry 70 proposed to be inserted in Schedule I relating to sports goods by sub-clause (2) of clause 6 of the Bill empowers the State Government to specify the sports goods which shall be exempted from levy of sales or purchase tax. The delegation of legislative power as proposed is necessary and is of normal character."
