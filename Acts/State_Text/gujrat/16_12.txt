Gujarat Sales Tax (Third Amendment) Act, 1986_Section 1--> State(s): Gujarat This Act may be called the Gujarat Sales Tax (Third Amendment) Act, 1986.

The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Gujarat Sales Tax (Third Amendment) Bill, 1986 (Bill No. 40 of 1986) (Gujarat Government Gazette, Extraordinary, Part V, dated 15th March, 1986, page 20-3.), runs as follows :- "Under the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, 1969, no tax is levied on the sales, to a recognised dealer (i.e., a manufacturer) or a commission agent purchasing on behalf of a recognised dealer of goods other than prohibited goods as defined in clause (21) of section 2 of that Act for use by the recognised dealer as raw or processing materials or as consumable stores in the manufacture of taxable goods for sale by him, if a certificate to that effect is given by such recognised dealer or commission agent, but a purchase tax is levied in respect of those purchases by a recognised dealer or the commission agent at the rate of two paise in the rupee. In respect of most of the prohibited goods purchased by a manufacturer for use in the manufacture of goods by him, he is required to pay sales tax at the rate of 4 per cent. Thus the Act provides for levy of tax on the goods purchased by a manufacturer for the use in the manufacture of goods by him at concessional rates. The manufacturer is also provided by the State Governmen t necessary infrastructural facilities for carrying out his business of manufacture in the State. However, it is noticed that in cases where a manufacturer despatches the goods manufactured by him to his own place of business or to his agent's place of business outside the State but within India, such despatch of manufactured goods results in unintended loss of sales tax revenue to the State Government. In order to avoid such loss of sales tax revenue to the State Government, it is proposed to levy, in addition to the tax payable under the said Act, a purchase tax at the rate of 2 per cent on the purchases of the goods other than declared goods by a manufacturer for use by him in the manufacture of goods which are so despatched by him. This Bill seeks to amend the said Act to achieve the aforesaid object."
