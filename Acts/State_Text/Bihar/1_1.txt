Bihar Abolition of Zamindaris Repealing Act, 1950_Section Preamble--> State(s): Bihar An Act to repeal the Bihar Abolition of Zamindaris Act, 1948 Whereas it is expedient to repeal the Bihar Abolition of Zamindaris Act, 1948; The passing of this Repealing Act was rendered necessary because Maharaja of Darbhanga instituted a Title Suit Challenging the validity of the Bihar Abolition of Zamindaris Act, 1948. That Title Suit which was subsequently transferred to the High Court reveled certain grave lacuna in the objectives of the Act and it was in order to forestal those objections that the present Repealing Act was passed just on the eve of the hearing of the Title Suit. It is hereby enacted as follows:-
Bihar Abolition of Zamindaris Repealing Act, 1950_Section 1--> State(s): Bihar This Act may be called the Bihar Abolition of Zamindaris Repealing Act, 1950.
Bihar Abolition of Zamindaris Repealing Act, 1950_Section 2--> State(s): Bihar The Bihar Abolition of Zamindaris Act, 1948, is hereby repealed.
