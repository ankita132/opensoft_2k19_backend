Bihar State Government Employees' Pension, Family Pension and Death-cum-Retirement Gratuity (Validation and Enforcement) Act, 2001_Section Preamble--> State(s): Bihar An Act to validate and enforce the revisions of pension, family pension and death-cum-retirement gratuity for Bihar State Government Employees. Whereas, the State Cabinet while accepting revision of pay/pension for State Government employees in principle on the pattern of Central Government had also decided to await report of its Fifth Pay Revision Committee. And, Whereas, having regard to the financial resource crunch and impact of enforcement of Fifth Pay Revision Commission report in December 1986 involving burden of Rupees several hundred crores due to the agreement made with the employees, the Government of Bihar had passed Resolution No. 806, dated February, 1989 constituting Fitment-cum-Pay Revision Committee for granting Central Pay Scales and Pension/Gratuity benefits to the employees notionally with effect from 1st January 1986 but actually with effect from 1st March, 1989 and stipulated that arrears will not be paid for the period 1st January, 1986 to 28th February, 1989; And, Whereas, the Government of Bihar had passed and issued Resolution dated 18th December, 1989 regarding pay revision and Resolution No. 1853F, for pension and gratuity to employees who retired on or after 1st January, 1986 and Resolution No. 1854F for pensionary benefits of employees who retired before 1986, and in each case, express provision was made for granting actual pay/pension revision from 1st March, 1989 and notionally from 1st January, 1986 but excluding arrears between 1st January, 1986 to 28th February, 1989; And, Whereas, the cut-off principle adopted as above for pay revision was upheld by a Full Bench of the Patna High Court in CWJC No. 511 of 1994 as being consistent with the Constitution of India; And, Whereas, a Division Bench of the Patna High Court allowed CWJC No. 2467/1991 and quashed Para 1(1) of Resolution No. 1853F and Para 2(1) of Resolution No. 1854F meant for pensionary benefits and directed the Government to reconsider the matter, and the Special Leave Petition filed by the State Government in the Supreme Court has been dismissed on 20th January, 1997 and the Review filed has also been dismissed; AND WHEREAS, SLP No. 1672/1999 filed by the State Government against order passed in contempt proceedings in MJC No. 1608/1997 has been dismissed due to infructuous; And, Whereas, CWJC No. 2082/1996 pertaining to pension arrears had been dismissed by Ld. Single Judge following the Full Bench Judgment in H.Kujur's case but the said judgment was reversed by a Division Bench of Ranch Bench the Patna High Court following the judgment of the earlier Division Bench judgment dated the 21st August, 1996 and in the SLP filed by the State Government before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the said judgment have been held to be irrelevant in view of the statement made by the respondents for withdrawing the writ petition; And, Whereas, in its judgment dated the 21st August, 1996, the Division Bench of the Patna High Court had observed that the Government could have fixed 1st March, 1989 or date of passing of the impugned Resolution i.e., 19th April, 1990 as the cut-off date but the Government, after fixing 1st January, 1986 on the Central pattern, had no justification to deny the consequential monetary benefits and make the same effective only from 1st March, 1989, and had required the Government to re-consider the matter in accordance with law; And, Whereas, the State Government after considering the matter, has come to the conclusion that in view of inadequate financial resources, it is not possible to bear the additional financial burden regarding arrears of pension, and that the financial burden is likely to increase substantially due to various writ petitions pending in the High Court for questioning the same cut-off principle with regard to gratuity; And, Whereas the Supreme Court has held that financial burden is an important factor in determining cut-off dates; And, Whereas due to the complete quashing of Para 1 (1) of Resolution No. 1853F, an anomaly has arisen as this para pertains even to the employees retiring after 1st March, 1989. And, Whereas it has become necessary to validate and enforce the revision of pension/family pension/gratuity with effect from 1st March, 1989 only; Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Bihar in the fifty second year of the Republic of India as follows:-
