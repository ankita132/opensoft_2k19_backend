(2) Upon receipt of such directions, the Corporation shall issue notices to the plot holder, in the industrial area or industrial estate calling upon them to furnish to it the information in the prescribed form and when so called upon each plot holder shall be bound to furnish true and correct information required within one month from the date of receipt of such notice by him/her.
